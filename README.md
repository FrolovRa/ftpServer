# ftpServer
Simple implementation of a FTP server in Java. This was a class project for COMP4621 (Computer Communication Networks) at
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

## Features
* Works with the standard Linux/Mac command line ftp tool
* Not working with grahical clients, since the directory listings are not in /bin/ls format
* Supports both active and passive mode data connection
* Multi threaded (allowing multiple connections at the same time)

## Configuration
1. Set "controlPort" in Server.java (needs to be above 1024 if you're not running the JVM in sudo mode, e.g. within your IDE)
2. Set folders: root, currDirectory and fileSeparator in Worker.java
3. If client and server are not on the same host, you need to add the client IP address to myIp in handlePasv().

## Supported FTP commands
* USER
* PASS
* PASV
* EPASV
* PORT
* EPRT
* MKD
* RMD
* CWD
* PWD
* TYPE
* RETR
* STOR
* QUIT
* SYST
* FEAT
